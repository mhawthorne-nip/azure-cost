- Comprehensive troubleshooting procedures
- Security best practices and compliance guidelines

**Enhanced Monitoring:**
- Improved data quality validation
- Better error detection and reporting
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
- Performance metrics tracking

**Operational Excellence:**
- Simplified deployment procedures
- Better debugging tools and commands
- Enhanced cost monitoring and alerting
- Improved backup and recovery procedures

**Future Roadmap:**
- Q1 2025: Predictive cost modeling and automated optimization
- Q2 2025: Integration with ServiceNow, Slack, and Power BI
- Q3 2025: Advanced automation and budget enforcement
- Q4 2025: Enterprise-scale multi-tenant support

### Breaking Changes

#### Version 2.0.0
- **Configuration Changes**: Updated `terraform.tfvars` structure requires migration
- **Database Schema**: New Log Analytics table schema incompatible with v1.x
- **Authentication**: Managed identity replaces service principal authentication
- **Naming Convention**: All resources renamed to follow Azure CAF standards

### Migration Guide

#### From 1.x to 2.x
1. Backup existing cost data
2. Update `terraform.tfvars` with new variable structure
3. Run `terraform plan` to review changes
4. Execute `terraform apply` to upgrade infrastructure
5. Verify data collection and email functionality

### Support Policy

- **Current Version (2.2.x)**: Full support with bug fixes and security updates
- **Previous Version (2.1.x)**: Security updates only until October 2025
- **Legacy Versions (1.x)**: End of life, upgrade recommended

### Security Advisories

#### SA-2025-001: Managed Identity Permissions
Ensure automation account managed identity has minimum required permissions:
- Cost Management Reader (required for all subscriptions)
- Reader (required for resource metadata)
- Billing Reader (required for detailed billing information)
- Log Analytics Contributor (required for data ingestion)

#### SA-2025-002: Key Vault Access
Regularly rotate secrets stored in Key Vault:
- Anthropic API key: Annual rotation recommended
- Email client secret: 90-day rotation recommended
- Monitor access logs for unauthorized access
