# Azure Cost Management API Rate Limiting Improvements

## Problem Analysis
The collection script was experiencing frequent HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" errors from the Azure Cost Management API, causing data collection failures and incomplete cost reporting.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Retry Logic with Aggressive Backoff
- **Increased max retries**: From 5 to 7 attempts for Cost Management queries
- **Extended base delay**: From 30 to 60 seconds for rate-limited requests
- **Progressive exponential backoff**: More aggressive timing for 429 errors
- **Maximum delay caps**: 10 minutes for rate limits, 3 minutes for server errors
- **Checkpoint logging**: Progress updates during long delays

### 2. Inter-Subscription Rate Limiting
- **Increased subscription delay**: From 30 to 90 seconds between subscriptions
- **Pre-API call delays**: 30-second delays before major API operations
- **Progress tracking**: Monitoring API call frequency and rate limit hits
- **Adaptive recommendations**: Suggests delay increases based on performance

### 3. API Call Optimization
- **Enhanced timeout values**: 120 seconds for main queries, 60 seconds for secondary calls
- **Structured retry patterns**: Different strategies for different error types
- **Rate limit recovery**: Extended delays specifically for 429 errors
- **API call counting**: Tracks total calls and rate limit hit percentage

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- **Status code specific logic**: Tailored responses for 400, 401, 403, 404, 429, 5xx errors
- **Rate limit hit tracking**: Monitors and reports rate limiting statistics
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues processing when possible despite errors
- **Detailed logging**: Enhanced error reporting for troubleshooting

## Configuration Changes

### Key Parameters
```powershell
# Enhanced rate limiting configuration
$subscriptionDelaySeconds = 90      # Between subscription processing
$apiCallDelaySeconds = 30           # Before each major API call
$MaxRetries = 7                     # For Cost Management queries
$BaseDelaySeconds = 60              # Base delay for rate limit backoff
```

### Retry Timing Matrix
| Error Type | Initial Delay | Max Delay | Backoff Strategy |
|------------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| Rate Limit (429) | 60s | 600s (10m) | Exponential with jitter |
| Server Error (5xx) | 30s | 180s (3m) | Progressive backoff |
| Other Errors | 10s | 120s (2m) | Standard exponential |

## Monitoring and Reporting

### New Execution Metrics
- Total execution time and API call count
- Rate limit hit frequency and percentage
- Average processing time per subscription
- Performance-based recommendations

### Rate Limiting Recommendations
The script now provides dynamic recommendations based on performance:
- Suggests delay increases if rate limit hit rate > 20%
- Recommends processing fewer subscriptions per execution
- Advises monitoring Azure Service Health for API issues

## Expected Improvements

### Reliability
- **Reduced 429 errors**: Aggressive backoff should minimize rate limit hits
- **Better fault tolerance**: Enhanced error handling prevents script failures
- **Consistent data collection**: More reliable API interactions

### Performance Trade-offs
- **Longer execution times**: Increased delays will extend total runtime
- **More predictable timing**: Consistent delays reduce variability
- **Better resource utilization**: Prevents API quota exhaustion

## Usage Guidelines

### For High-Volume Environments
- Consider splitting subscriptions across multiple scheduled runs
- Monitor rate limit hit percentage in execution logs
- Adjust delays based on actual performance metrics

### For Development/Testing
- Reduce subscription counts for faster testing cycles
- Use execution metrics to optimize delay configurations
- Test with single subscriptions before full deployment

## Monitoring Commands

```powershell
# Check recent execution performance
az automation job list --resource-group "rg-nip-costing-dev-eus" --automation-account-name "aa-nip-costing-dev-eus" --runbook-name "rb-cost-collection"

# Review execution logs for rate limiting metrics
az automation job get-output --resource-group "rg-nip-costing-dev-eus" --automation-account-name "aa-nip-costing-dev-eus" --job-name "<job-id>"
```

## Future Optimizations

### Potential Improvements
- **Adaptive delay adjustment**: Automatically tune delays based on API response times
- **Subscription batching**: Process subscriptions in smaller groups
- **API health monitoring**: Check Azure service health before execution
- **Parallel processing**: Implement subscription-level parallelism with rate limiting

### Cost Management API Best Practices
- **Use minimal queries**: Request only necessary data fields
- **Optimize date ranges**: Balance data completeness with API efficiency
- **Cache authentication tokens**: Reuse tokens across API calls
- **Monitor API quotas**: Track usage against service limits

This implementation significantly improves the reliability of cost data collection while maintaining comprehensive error handling and monitoring capabilities.
